LSOE
====

Initial fumblings towards implementation of LSOE in Python.

Probably needs to be Python 3 at this point.

Will probably use Tornado initially so don't have to learn entire
asyncio API in a hurry, but long term it may be possible to do
everything we need with standard libraries, since all we really need
is datagram sockets, coroutines, and supporting primatives like queues.

Raw ethernet frame socket I/O is not well documented, see Linux
packet(7) for what doc there is.

Half-assed Example of sending an ethernet frame, although we probably
want to use .sendto() which may require extra fields:

Purported explanation of those extra fields as seen by .recvfrom():
